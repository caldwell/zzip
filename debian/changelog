zzip (2.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed blowfish algorithm back to standard blowfish. This is an
    incompatible change, so the major version got bumped.

zzip (1.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added support for new Key file format (version 2). The old format is

zzip (1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * If we are encrypting, we now align the length of the data to an 8 byte
    boundary. This happens after compressing, as compressing changes the
    length (duh.). This fixes the problem where the loader would get
    decompression errors on most files that were both compressed and
    encrypted. Some files would be aligned after compression and so they
    would work, and that really threw me off.

zzip (1.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial Release.
